            Mik is a new startup that has every intention of making your life
            easier. The idea came about after Founder, Leo Gonzalez found

            and Tech Lifestyle

            As the world becomes united and technology allows for constant and
            instant communication, a new challenge of timing has arrived-while
            the west coast is sleeping, the east coast rises and Europe is well
            within their day. When on Earth can we all get together to meet.

            Due to this global collaboration, Leo found himself tired of working
            all hours of the day and night and decided to create Mik.
